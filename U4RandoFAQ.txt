Ultma 4 Quest of the Avatar Randomizer

I.  Motivation
Dragon Warrior randomizer is one of the most fun and popular randomizers out right now, as winning it is more about strategy and planning rather than pure execution.  However, what if there were a game with many more search spots, virtually no grinding necessary, and a little bit of first-person dungeon crawling goodness?  In Ultima 4: Quest of the Avatar, you are always in go mode.  This game is about efficient movement to all the places you need to go, with a little bit of risk-reward along the way.





II. Features and Usage
This is a Java application that requires having a copy of the NES Ultima 4 ROM.  If you use the UI it will list the flags that the randomizer will use as you select options.  A # following the flag means that the flag can be followed up with more options (the default is 1).  The following flags determine what to randomize and feature:

M:  Randomize overworld map.  See the map generation notes for more information.

D:  Randomize dungeon layouts.  Each dungeon has 8 floors and the randomizer only randomizes floors 2-7 of each dungeon *except* Hythloth, which remains the same. That is, floors 2-7 of each dungeon except Hythloth are shuffled and assigned to the other dungeons.  For example Deceit could be Deceit B1, Covetous B4, Destard B7, Shame B6, Deceit B3, Wrong B4, Despise B2, and Deceit B8.  Stairs are added and removed to get to each part of the dungeon as needed. 

R#: Randomize items in search locations.  This includes all search locations, including the fungus and manroot search spots as well as item bearing chests (not the virtue killing gold ones). If the # is 1 then the fungus and manroot spots will be excluded in the shuffling.  Does not include the chests for avatar equipment in Lyceaum and Empath Abbey.  Magincia might not be a useless place to visit after all...

O:  Randomize moongate exit locations.  For example, new moons can go to Jhelom instead of Moonglow.

V#: Randomize initial virtue. The # means the following: 0=set all virtues to 0, 1=set all virtues to the same random number between 0 and 99, 2=set all virtues to 99.  Use V2 to avoid all that virtue grinding.

G#: Randomize initial gold.  The # means the following: 0=set initial gold to 0, 1=set it to a random number between 0 and 400, 2=set it to a random number between 0 and 1000.

B#:  Randomize equippable weapons and armor for each character.  Each piece of equipment has an 8-bit value designating who can use that piece of equipment.  The # means the following: 1=Shuffle the character(s) who can use the equipment (shift any 1s to a random value; for example the Robe can only be used by the Shepherd and setting this flag makes the Robe usable by exactly one random class).  2=Pure randomization of this number (it is possible for any equipment to be used by any combination of characters).

Q#:  Randomize starting equipment for each character.  Each character gets 1 weapon and 1 piece of armor.  The # means the following: 1=shuffle existing starting equipment, 2=have each character start with a random weapon and a random armor (does not give Avatar-only equipment).

Additional note: Using either B or Q sets character inital equipment to be unequipped.

H#:  Randomize starting herbs.  The # means the following: 1=shuffle initial herb counts, which start off at 8,8,9,7,8,4,0,and 0.  2=get a random amount from 0 to 9 of each herb.





III.  Notes on map generation
I didn't know what to put here so I decided to simply describe the map generation algorithm at the end.  Just note that the algorithm is slightly biased toward placing things on the sea, as a lot of things are reqired to be there, and that the game uses visibility zones to control what is visible as you traverse the map.  The abyss is always on a crater, and the map has a maximum of three accessible craters to check. Currently, no attempt is made to place shrines and dungeons closest to their corresponding virtue towns, so anything can be anywhere.




IV.  Future Development
The following flags are things that I would like to implement, and are an open discussion to see what changes could be made to the game for a more engaging experience.
Also, the current version doesn't change the closing credits in any way to acknowledge that roms are generated via a randomizer.  Furthermore, I am not sure about how gems and the Telesope work on the overworld map (but they should work fine in dungeons).

k:  Disable the Blink spell. This spell is brokenly powerful for its cost.  Is discretion really the better part of Valor, Avatar, or are you just another coward?

D:  Full Dungeon randomization including floors 1, 8, and all Hythloth floors.  The current flag would be changed to "d".  I consider this too risky for version 1 as you could find rooms to Altars in early floors.

I:  Helpful villagers.  This will require much work as all game text is huffman encoded.

K:  Randomize initially known magic spells.  This will require editing in villager text to give you the reagents for spells you don't know.

j:  Randomize spell reagents required.

J:  Randomize spell casting costs.

e:  Randomize enemy stats.

E:  Tough enemy stats.

x:  Fix text.  Dastard, not Destard.  Ranger, not ranger.  Fix stone conversations so that the proper answers give the proper outcomes. (Example: Orange stone proper answer should be "No" not "Yes"). 

L, l:  One of the most brokenly powerful mechanics is that you can get magic basically for free by just ripping off the blind herb ladies. The lower case "l" option forces you to pay at least half of the price the herb lady is asking for, "L" forces full price.

N: Honest pricing overall.  Forces you to pay 100% of the price to the herb lady and eliminates price negotiation at weapon and armor shops.

T: Randomizes store selling lists.

C: Randomizes store prices.

S: Stern mode. Strong virtue penalties.  Any action that would cause you to lose virtue sets that virtue to 0.

V3: Start as avatar.

F: Perfection mode.  Eliminate the ability to gain virtue.  You start with 100 in each virtue but you cannot gain any virtue; thus any action that will cost you virtue results in a permanent soft-lock.

A: Chaos Mode.  Encompasses all flags except L,P,R, N and F.  Future versions will randomize character and enemy stats.

W: Fast walking.  Walk at 4x the speed you normally go.

w: Begin with Key.

X: Fast text.

Y: Randomize floors 2-7 of the Abyss (got cut from ver. 1.0 because I still need to look at Abyss stair mechanics)

y: Skip the Abyss.

D2:  Make Dungeon Hell levels.  A hell level is one that triggers an enemy encounter every step.

U: Tournament Mode.  Sets the suggested tournament flags MDYROVQbH. 

Again, this is a current comprehensive list of things I could do, but not necessarily will do.  I'm leaning towards options that increase game difficulty by injecting risk (tougher enemies) and speed hacks.  I am leaning against options that take away player agency, such as enforcing fair pricing (it looks like it might be a pain to hack in anyway).

 
Addendum 1.  The Map Generation Algorithm
Note: X..Y means random number between X and Y, inclusive

The map is generated by designating 9..15 zones (boxes with length and width 30..50 each that don't overlap) that can be plains, forest, mountain, or sea.  The first 7 are automatically designated as 3 sea, 2 plains, 1 forest and 1 mountain.  Any remaining ones are randomized, with distribution of 50% sea, 25% plains, 15% forest and 10% mountain.  These zones spread via floodfill, with a 15% chance to overtake land already claimed by another zone.  

Then, anywhere from 50..75 features are randomly placed on the map, where each feature is a box with with and height 12..30 each that may overlap at most 1 other feature.  For each feature you place, determine if it is dominantly on land or sea, and place a required feature or a random feature.  Sea required features are the horn island, the bell dive spot, and the skull dive spot (these cannot overlap any other features).  Land required features are 2 shrubs, 8 river deltas, 3 mountains, 3 swamps, and 1 lake.  All other feautures are random, and can be shrubs, forests, mountains, swamps, or lakes if on land, and islands, archipelagos, shoals, and volcanic islands if on sea.  Each feature is assigned the zone it is on.

After that the map is smoothed, which adds in shrub around the forests, plateus around the mountains, and shallow water around the islands and continents.  The three sea search spots are then re-placed just in case any of them were deformed during the smoothing process.

Now we palce points of interest (POI).  All POI are given a rectangle that no other POI can land on to ensure that nothing gets overwritten.

Place the 8 virtuous towns.  The 8 Vituous towns are placed on either a non-mountain zone or feature.  These features attempt to not be the same feature as another vituous town.  2 of them must be placed on islands.  Place the town and surround it with a box of plains tiles.

Place the 8 moongates, each in a small knight's move away from the virtuous towns.  Partition the box from the moongate to the town into 2..4 random smaller boxes and fill each small box with plains or shrub.  Surround the moongate with four plains.

Place the 8 dungeons.  Each dungeon must be on a mountain feature, an island, a volcanic island, or on a feature on a mountain zone.  Select a mountain on that feature and replace it with the dungeon, then surround it with 3 mountain spots and an opening (which has a good chance to be poison marsh).

Place the 8 shrines.  Shrines can be on practically any feature, even shoals.  Place the shrine and a random 3-box corner of shrub or plains on the map, except for the Srine of Humility, which gets special treatment*.

Place the castles.  The 4 castles can be on any forest or plains zone.  Find a sea anchor for the zone via floodfill and move the castle in a small knight's move away from that anchor.  make it a 4x4 area with plains and the 4 castle spots (castle W, castle E and the 2 castle flags) in the center.

Place the other towns.  These have the same rules as placing viruous towns.  The first 2 of them require sea anchors.

Place the abyss, which must be on a volcanic island.  Find each volcanic island and get the crater spots on them.  While there are more than 3 crater spots, replace one of them with lava. Finally select one of them as the Abyss.  If there are no crater spots then one is created and made the abyss.

Now ensure access to each location via floodfill checks.  Each location needs access to a virtuous town, with moongates requiring walk access and each other location reqiring walk or sea access.  Ensure access by drawing a line from the edge of the inwardly accessible tile to the nearest openly accessable tile. Two dungeons do not require walk or sea access and are instead given balloon access (a 2x2 area of plains in a spot that is walk accessible to the dungeon).

Place the whirlpool on any deep-sea spot.

Place the balloon in a small knight's move away from any dungeon opening, first selecting any dungeon that has only balloon access.  The dungeon next to the ballon will become Hythloth.

Finally, assign visibility zones to each tile.  In the original game, the first 2 bits of a tile corresponded to a visibility zone, allowing for up to 4 zones of visibility as you traversed the map.  Starting at 0,0, floodfill visibility until you get to a mountain or forest tile (inclusively).  If you find a deep-sea tile you are on the main branch (0), otherwise you are assigned zone 1.  Forests are assigned zone 2 and Mountains are assigned zone 3.

Next, identify branches in the main branch that go into mountains.  Find small, thin areas that branch off of the main branch and assign them to zone 1.  (Note: the algorithm that does this isn't extensively tested so don't expect perfection here).

The final step is to convert each tile into its proper corresponding tile in the game.  Plains, shrubs, plateau and water tiles all have corresponding corners and sides so those are calculated for output to the final map.  Note: this is not perfect, as I do not take into account the very few 3-sided and 4-sided permutations of corners.  However, the original game wasn't perfect with this either.

*The Shrine of Humility begins blocked by a 5 mountains in a ring on the south edge and 3 spike tiles on its north edge.  If opening access requires a change to this, the north side is blocked by a mountain and the game notes the new opening to place spike tiles at.
