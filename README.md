# U4Rando
Ultima 4 NES Randomizer

Download all the files and put them into the same directory.  If you have a .cfg file from older versions delete it.  This requires Java 1.6 or later and the Ultima 4 NES Rom.
See the FAQ for usage.

New in ver 1.2:
- You can set the balloon to be next to Castle Britannia (instead of outside Hythloth)
- Calumney of Yew gives the proper location for Manroot and Basil of Moonglow gives you the proper location for Fungus
- You can now randomize enemy attacks
- You can now randomly make enemies tougher (25, 50, or 75% of the game's enemies have thier HP, attack and defense tripled and give 5x the EXP)
- You can now randomize the spells given to you by spell-teaching villagers
- The Black Stone of Humility can be picked up at anytime; no need to wait for new moons

New in ver 1.1:
- You can now start as Avatar
- You can now add a sea border to generated maps (to make them smaller)
- You can now include the chests at Empath Abbey and the Lyceaum for item shuffling
- You can now randomize initially known spells, as well as specifically exclude Heal and Blink
- You can now add gold to each gold chest
- Also fixed a UI bug.
- There is a known UI inconsistency where the flag order in the UI and the flag order in the generated ROM will be different.  This may be fixed in a future version.

Known bugs and issues:
- The negate spell doesn't always wear off after battles (it will wear off if you enter a new battle)
- The stairs in dungeon stone rooms do not work (you will need to step outside and cast exit)
- Basil's text doesn't stop after the second phrase and Calumney's text has a minor graphical artifact
- The overworld map doesn't always open up your vision to beyond a 3x3 area after exiting a forest or exiting a battle on a forest next to an open area

Note: Some interest was expressed in the source code for this Rando.  I have uploaded the lastest java file.  I use launch4j to build the downloadable Windows executable; feel free to look at/play with/suggest bug fixes.
